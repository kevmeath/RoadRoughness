# Road Roughness

This is an Android application to measure the roughness of a road. Using the various sensors that come with Android phones the roughness of a road can be measured by recording the vibrations produced by inconsistencies on the surface of the road. A value for roughness is determined by the vertical distance accumulated per kilometer traveled.


## Project Setup

1.	Install Java
2.	Install Android Studio
3.	Clone repository
4.	Open in Android Studio


To run the app a Maps SDK API key is required. The API key can be freely obtained via Google Cloud Console.
Instructions for acquiring an API key can be found here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/start#get-key.
Once you have an API key, add it to the local.properties file in the form of `MAPS_API_KEY=<API_KEY>`.
